Our favourite modules
The Python Standard Library has a lot of modules! To help you get familiar with what's available, here are a selection of our favourite Python Standard Library modules and why we use them!

csv: very convenient for reading and writing csv files
collections: useful extensions of the usual data types including OrderedDict, defaultdict and namedtuple
random: generates pseudo-random numbers, shuffles sequences randomly and chooses random items
string: more functions on strings. This module also contains useful collections of letters like string.digits (a string containing all characters which are valid digits).
re: pattern-matching in strings via regular expressions
math: some standard mathematical functions
os: interacting with operating systems
os.path: submodule of os for manipulating path names
sys: work directly with the Python interpreter
json: good for reading and writing json files (good for web work)

#Third party library
'''
IPython - A better interactive Python interpreter
requests - Provides easy to use methods to make web requests. Useful for accessing web APIs.
Flask - a lightweight framework for making web applications and APIs.
Django - A more featureful framework for making web applications. Django is particularly good for designing complex, content heavy, web applications.
Beautiful Soup - Used to parse HTML and extract information from it. Great for web scraping.
pytest - extends Python's builtin assertions and unittest module.
PyYAML - For reading and writing YAML files.
NumPy - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things a powerful N-dimensional array object and useful linear algebra capabilities.
pandas - A library containing high-performance, data structures and data analysis tools. In particular, pandas provides dataframes!
matplotlib - a 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments.
ggplot - Another 2D plotting library, based on R's ggplot2 library.
Pillow - The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.
pyglet - A cross-platform application framework intended for game development.
Pygame - A set of Python modules designed for writing games.
pytz - World Timezone Definitions for Python

Quiz: Compute an Exponent
It's your turn to import and use the math module. Use the math module to calculate e to the power of 3. print the answer.

# print e to the power of 3 using the math module
import math
print(math.exp(3))

Quiz: Password Generator
Write a function called generate_password that selects three random words 
from the list of words word_list and concatenates them into a single string. 
Your function should not accept any arguments and should reference the 
global variable word_list to build the password.
'''
# Use an import statement at the top
import random

word_file = "8_words.txt"
word_list = []

#fill up the word_list
with open(word_file,'r') as words:
	for line in words:
		# remove white space and make everything lowercase
		word = line.strip().lower()
		# don't include words that are too long or too short
		if 3 < len(word) < 8:
			word_list.append(word)

# Add your function generate_password here
# It should return a string consisting of three random words 
# concatenated together without spaces
def generate_password():
    data_list = ""
    for i in range(3):
        data_list += word_list[random.randint(i,len(word_list))]
    return(data_list)


# test your function
print(generate_password())
